# Zaharam-Chapelle-Parunas-Questionnaire
I've inputted the Zaharam–Chapelle–Parunas Questionnaire on Obsidian to help with making new worlds. Right now there are only folders to add new documents too and they can be added onto any way you want. This is to be used on the application Obsidian MD but could also just be used in the File Explorer.
