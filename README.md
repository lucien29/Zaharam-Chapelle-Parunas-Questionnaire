# Zaharam-Chapelle-Parunas-Questionnaire
I've inputted the Zaharam–Chapelle–Parunas Questionnaire on Obsidian to help with making new worlds. Right now there are only folders to add new documents too and they can be added onto any way you want. This is to be used on the application Obsidian MD but could also just be used in the File Explorer.

HOW TO USE
Download Obsidian Md here: https://obsidian.md/
Download Compressed Folder
Extract Compressed Folder
When you open Obsidian, click "Open Folder as Vault"
Open the folder named Zaharam–Chapelle–Parunas Questionnaire
In the World Folder are all of the important subsections that are in the Questionnaire, the Universe folder is for more World Building (Unfinished)
